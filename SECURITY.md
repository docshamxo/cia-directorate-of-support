# Security

Webhook URLs and bot tokens can post into Discord channels. Keep them private.

**Affiliation:** This repository supports an **unofficial Roblox community**. It is **not affiliated with** the United States Government or the Central Intelligence Agency. Community markings (`PUBLIC` / `STAFF` / `CANDIDATE`) are roleplay vocabulary only.

## Rules

- Store secrets only in your local `.env`
- Use `python bootstrap.py` to create `.env` from `.env.example`
- Never commit `.env`, paste webhooks into PRs, or share them in chat
- Prefer explicit `git add path/to/file` over `git add .` when staging changes
- `.webhook_messages.json` is local state (message IDs only) — it is gitignored; do not commit it
- `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` is a secret (same rules as webhook URLs) — required for ✅ reactions
- `DISCORD_INVITE_URL` and `DISCORD_OSEC_APPLICATION_RESULTS_URL` live in `.env` (not in public YAML)
- Staff Drive / TTP URLs belong in gitignored `config/links.staff.local.yaml` (copy from `config/links.staff.example.yaml`)
- Do **not** commit new public staff share links; keep them in the local overlay

## If a webhook leaks

1. Open the Discord channel → **Integrations** → **Webhooks**
2. Delete or regenerate the leaked webhook
3. Update the matching `WEBHOOK_...=` line in your local `.env`
4. Confirm `.env` is not staged: `git status`
5. Optionally reset local message IDs for that key in `.webhook_messages.json` (see [OPS.md](OPS.md))
6. Re-run only the affected announcer (or `python run_all.py`)

## If a bot token leaks

1. Discord Developer Portal → your application → **Bot** → **Reset Token**
2. Update `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=` in local `.env`
3. Confirm the bot still has **Add Reactions** + **Read Message History** in the target server
4. Re-run a single dry-run then one live announcer to verify ✅ reactions

## If a staff Drive link leaks

1. In Google Drive, change sharing on the folder/doc (remove link access or rotate to a new folder)
2. Update `config/links.staff.local.yaml` with the new URLs
3. Confirm the public `config/links.yaml` still shows `STAFF_LOCAL_REQUIRED` placeholders only
4. Re-run the affected staff announcer(s)

## Message ID retention / disposal

- `.webhook_messages.json` stores **message snowflakes only** (no webhook URLs or tokens)
- Delete the file (or prune keys) when rotating webhooks, rebuilding a channel, or disposing local state
- Live sends **post first**, then delete previously recorded IDs — a failed send should not empty the channel
- Webhooks cannot purge full channel history; unrecorded/manual posts must be deleted in Discord

## Repository protection (maintainers)

GitHub org/repo settings cannot always be changed via API. In the repository **Settings**:

1. Enable **Push protection** for secret scanning (Settings → Code security → Push protection)
2. Consider **Rulesets** / branch protection on `main` with **Require a pull request** and, if appropriate, **Do not allow bypassing the above settings** (`enforce_admins`)
3. Keep [`.github/CODEOWNERS`](.github/CODEOWNERS) reviewed on PRs that touch `common/`, `config/`, or `.github/`

## Code scanning

- GitHub **code scanning** runs via Advanced Setup: the CodeQL workflow at `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` analyzes Python on pushes and pull requests to `main`, plus a weekly schedule
- Results appear under the repository **Security** tab (Code scanning alerts)

## Operational notes

- After each successful post, the suite adds ✅ via the Discord bot API when `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` is set (webhooks cannot react on their own)
- Use `python run_all.py --dry-run` to preview embeds without posting, deleting, or reacting
- Pass `--require-reaction` (or `CIA_REQUIRE_REACTION=1`) to fail if ✅ cannot be applied
- See [OPS.md](OPS.md) for runbook steps (rotate webhook, reset state, empty-channel recovery, bot perms)
